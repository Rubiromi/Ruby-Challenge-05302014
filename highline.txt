Highline does:

 1. HighLine was designed to ease the tedious tasks of doing console input and output with low-level methods like gets() and puts().
 2. HighLine provides a robust system for requesting data from a user, without needing to code all the error checking and validation rules
 3. and without needing to convert the typed Strings into what your program really needs. .

How to use:

 1. Type conversion for answers:

    ask("Birthday?  ", Date)
    ask("Interests?  (comma sep list)  ", lambda { |str| str.split(/,\s*/) })
 2. Reading passwords:

    ask("Enter your password:  ") { |q| q.echo = false }
    ask("Enter your password:  ") { |q| q.echo = "x" }
 3. ERb based output (with HighLineâ€˜s ANSI color tools):

    say("This should be <%= color('bold', BOLD) %>!")
